 Hey, 👋  I'm <a href="https://zexinli.com/" target="_blank">Zexin Li</a>

# About ME
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Cong Liu. I received a bachelor’s degree from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) under the advice of Dr. Yuqun Zhang in July 2020.
My research interests lie in interdisciplinary fields of real-time embedded systems and on-device machine learning.

I am actively looking for cooperation in the following topics: (1) deploying machine learning models on real-time embedded devices, (2) system-application co-optimization of machine learning systems, and (3) improving performance robustness in machine learning systems.

I am on the job market now! I am currently on the 2025-2026 job market and open to opportunities in real-time embedded systems, on-device machine learning, cyber-physical systems, AI/ML, and embedded intelligent systems research. I welcome conversations with teams working on cutting-edge machine learning systems and embedded intelligent systems workflows. Feel free to reach out at 📧 zli536@ucr.edu if you believe there might be a fit.

<strong>Feel free to contact me if we share common research interests.</strong>
